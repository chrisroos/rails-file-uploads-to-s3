## Sample Rails app for uploading files to S3

I'm using this to explore uploading to S3 using the [jQuery File Upload plugin](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload).

You'll need to set a number of environment variables to configure the connection to S3. This project includes the [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) library so you can put these environment variables in '.env' within this folder.
